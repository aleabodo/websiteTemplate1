An experimental website project by Alexander Bell
alexbell.de

Feel free to fork and clone this project. You may also use this as an template for your private or comercial projects.

This project is developed with ReactJS. Run `/npm install` to install all packages and `/npm run start` to start the localhost development server and `/npm run build` to build the final built of the project.

###Important:
You will need to run this website on a server. Google Firebase Hosting has always been a good solution for me:

https://firebase.google.com

The reason is that react-router needs a server instance to push the history.
